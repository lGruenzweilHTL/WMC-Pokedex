## Mock Battle

The mock battle is a simple turn-based battle system where two players can fight against each other. The game is played in rounds, and each player can choose between different actions for their Pokémon.
The actions you can take include:

### Select Pokémon
Select which Pokémon you want to play with.

### Start Battle
The menu can be navigated using the arrow keys, the space key can be used to confirm/proceed, and the escape key can be used to cancel.
Both sides choose an option and execute it.
If a Pokémon loses all its HP, it will faint.
If all Pokémon on a team faint, the player loses.

In a battle, you can choose between the following options:
#### Attack
If you select the Fight option, you can use the Pokémon's moves. The moves can either damage the opponent or strengthen yourself.

#### Use Item
You can choose between four different healing potions, which can only be used once per battle.

#### Switch Pokémon
With this option, you can switch the battling Pokémon, as long as at least one is not fainted.

#### Run away
This allows you to end the battle.


## Who's that Pokémon

Who's that Pokémon is a quiz game where you have to guess the Pokémon based on its silhouette. The game consists of several rounds, and in each round, a silhouette of a Pokémon is displayed. You have to guess which Pokémon it is by selecting the correct answer from a list of options.
The game is played in rounds, and each round consists of the following steps:
1. A silhouette of a Pokémon is displayed.
2. The user has to type the correct name of the Pokémon. (The name is not case-sensitive and works with multiple languages)

The user can also choose to skip the round if they don't know the answer. In this case, the game will display the correct answer and move on to the next round.
