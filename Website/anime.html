      Ash is driven by his desire to win the Indigo Plateau's Pokémon League, a challenging tournament for outstanding Pokémon trainers who compete against each other in Pokémon battles.
      To qualify for the tournament, Ash must collect the required number of gym badges, which are tokens earned after defeating each of the Kanto region's elite Pokémon gym leaders.
      <br>
      <br>
      Early in the season, Ash befriends the water-type Pokémon trainer Misty (The leader of the Cerulean City Gym in the first generation games), who initially travels with Ash in hopes of him replacing her destroyed bicycle, and Brock, a Pokémon breeder who is the leader of the Pewter City gym.
      The trio often encounters Team Rocket, a mischievous duo—Jessie and James, accompanied by their talking Meowth—whose schemes to steal rare Pokémon, especially Ash's Pikachu, bring constant trouble. Despite their antics, they provide comic relief and recurring challenges for Ash and his friends as they journey through the Kanto region.
