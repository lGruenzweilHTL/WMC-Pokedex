        Team Rocket is a group of villains in the Pokémon games Red, Blue, and Yellow. They are an evil organization
        that wants to use Pokémon for their own profit and power. Led by their boss, Giovanni, they steal Pokémon, run
        secret operations, and cause trouble wherever they go. You meet their members, including the iconic duo Jessie
        and James in Yellow, throughout the story. Your goal is to stop their plans and show them that using Pokémon for
        good is always better!

    <p>

        In Pokémon Red, you play as a young Pokémon Trainer starting your journey in Pallet Town. Your goal is to become
        the Pokémon Champion by defeating Gym Leaders and earning eight Gym Badges. Along the way, you explore the Kanto
        region, catch Pokémon, and build a strong team.

        You also face the evil group Team Rocket, led by Giovanni, who uses Pokémon for crime and profit. Your task is
        to stop their plans, including taking down their hideout and rescuing Pokémon from their control.

        Throughout your adventure, your rival challenges you multiple times, testing your skills. In the end, you battle
        the Elite Four and the Champion to prove yourself as the strongest Trainer in the region. The game focuses on
        exploration, strategy, and the bond between you and your Pokémon
