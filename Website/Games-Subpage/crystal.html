        Team Rocket is a group of villains in the Pokémon games Red, Blue, and Yellow. They are an evil organization
        that wants to use Pokémon for their own profit and power. Led by their boss, Giovanni, they steal Pokémon,
        run
        secret operations, and cause trouble wherever they go. You meet their members, including the iconic duo
        Jessie
        and James in Yellow, throughout the story. Your goal is to stop their plans and show them that using Pokémon
        for
        good is always better!

<h2>Story and Features</h2>
<div id="description">

    <p>

        Pokémon Crystal follows the same main story as Gold & Silver: the player, a young trainer from New Bark Town,
        travels through Johto, battles eight Gym Leaders, stops Team Rocket, and challenges the Elite Four. However,
        Crystal introduces a special Suicune storyline. Instead of roaming, Suicune appears in key locations before a
        final battle at Tin Tower. A new character, Eusine, follows Suicune, trying to understand its power.


        Both Lugia and Ho-Oh are available but at different levels (Lugia at level 60, Ho-Oh at level 40). The game also
        introduces the Battle Tower, a female playable character (Kris), improved Pokémon animations, and small
        cutscenes. After defeating Champion Lance, the player can travel to Kanto, battle its Gym Leaders, and challenge
        Red at Mt.
        Silver.

        In Pokémon Crystal, players can choose to play as a girl for the first time. In Gold & Silver, you could only
        play as a boy, but now you can select Kris, the first female trainer in Pokémon history. This change made the
        game more inclusive.

        Pokémon Crystal introduces 100 new Pokémon, which brings the total number of Pokémon to 251. It also adds two
        new
        types, Dark and Steel, to make battles more interesting. The game features a day and night cycle, so some
        Pokémon only appear in the morning, while others show up at night. Breeding is another new feature: if you leave
        two compatible Pokémon at the Day Care, they can produce an Egg, which hatches into a baby Pokémon. Finally,
        after you win the Johto League, you can travel to the Kanto region and challenge the original Gym Leaders from
        Pokémon Red and Blue.

        Another new feature is the Battle Tower, a special place where players can battle strong trainers with different
        rules. Trainers must use Pokémon at certain levels and win multiple battles in a row. This was not in Gold &
        Silver and gave players a new challenge after finishing the main game.
