            Team Aqua serves as the primary villainous group in Pokémon Sapphire, led by Archie and obsessed with
            expanding
            the seas of the Hoenn region. Their plan hinges on awakening Kyogre, a legendary Pokémon capable of causing
            massive rainfall and flooding the land. Team Aqua’s members appear throughout Hoenn, often disrupting local
            life
            and challenging anyone who stands in their path, all in pursuit of their vision for a world of boundless
            ocean.

            Pokémon Sapphire takes place in the Hoenn region, a vast land filled with new Pokémon to collect and train.
            You
            begin as a young Pokémon Trainer who gathers Gym Badges, aims for the Champion title, and works to stop Team
            Aqua from carrying out its mission to awaken Kyogre, a legendary Pokémon that can expand the ocean. As you
            trek
            through forests, sail across seas, and visit hidden places, you’ll build a strong team to overcome tough
            battles
            and discover secrets. This game includes double battles, allowing you to fight using two Pokémon at once,
            and
            features Pokémon Contests where you show off each Pokémon’s unique moves and style. You can also create a
            Secret
            Base to decorate and share. With its lively graphics and advanced gameplay on the Game Boy Advance, Pokémon
            Sapphire offers a fun and memorable experience that many fans still cherish.
