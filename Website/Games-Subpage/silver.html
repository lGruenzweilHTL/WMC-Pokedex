    In Pokémon Gold Team Rocket appears again as the main evil group in the Johto region. They
    do not have their leader, Giovanni, so they try to become powerful again by cutting off Slowpoke tails and
    taking over the Goldenrod Radio Tower. They hope to make Giovanni return, but in the end, their plans fail.
    Still, their actions show how determined they are to regain their old power.

<h2>Story and Features</h2>
<div id="description">

  <p>

    In Pokémon Silver, you start in the Johto region as a new Pokémon Trainer. Soon after you receive your first
    Pokémon, you learn that a thief stole another Pokémon from Professor Elm’s lab. This person becomes your rival,
    and you meet him several times during your journey. At the same time, Team Rocket, an evil group from the Kanto
    region, returns. They try to regain power by cutting off Slowpoke tails and taking over the Goldenrod Radio
    Tower. They want their missing leader, Giovanni, to come back. Your main goals in the game are to collect
    Pokémon, earn Gym Badges, stop Team Rocket, and become the strongest Trainer in Johto.

    Pokémon Silver introduces 100 new Pokémon, which brings the total number of Pokémon to 251. It also adds two new
    types, Dark and Steel, to make battles more interesting. The game features a day and night cycle, so some
    Pokémon only appear in the morning, while others show up at night. Breeding is another new feature: if you leave
    two compatible Pokémon at the Day Care, they can produce an Egg, which hatches into a baby Pokémon. Finally,
    after you win the Johto League, you can travel to the Kanto region and challenge the original Gym Leaders from
    Pokémon Red and Blue.
