    Jessie
    and James in Yellow, throughout the story. Your goal is to stop their plans and show them that using Pokémon

    In Pokémon Blue, you play as a young Pokémon Trainer starting your journey in Pallet Town. Your goal is to
    become
    the Pokémon Champion by defeating Gym Leaders and earning eight Gym Badges. Along the way, you explore the

    region, catch Pokémon, and build a strong team.

    You also face the evil group Team Rocket, led by Giovanni, who uses Pokémon for crime and profit. Your task
    is
    to stop their plans, including taking down their hideout and rescuing Pokémon from their control.

    Throughout your adventure, your rival challenges you multiple times, testing your skills. In the end, you
    battle
    the Elite Four and the Champion to prove yourself as the strongest Trainer in the region. The game focuses
    on
    exploration, strategy, and the bond between you and your Pokémon
