        Team Rocket is a group of villains in the Pokémon games Red, Blue, and Yellow. They are an evil organization
        that wants to use Pokémon for their own profit and power. Led by their boss, Giovanni, they steal Pokémon, run
        secret operations, and cause trouble wherever they go. You meet their members, including the iconic duo Jessie
        and James in Yellow, throughout the story. Your goal is to stop their plans and show them that using Pokémon for
        good is always better!

<h2>Story and Features</h2>
<div id="description">


    <p>

        In Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition, you play as a young trainer from Pallet Town. Your adventure starts
        when Professor Oak gives you a special Pokémon: Pikachu. Unlike other games, Pikachu follows you everywhere and
        reacts to how you treat it. Your goal is to become a Pokémon Master by defeating Gym Leaders, completing the
        Pokédex, and challenging the Elite Four.
        What makes this game special is the close bond with Pikachu. It has a unique personality and even shows
        emotions. The game is inspired by the Pokémon anime, featuring characters like Team Rocket’s Jessie and James.
        It feels like you’re living in the Pokémon world!
