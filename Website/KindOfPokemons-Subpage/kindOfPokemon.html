    <h1>Different types of Pokémon</h1>

    <div class="general">

        <h2>General Pokémons</h2>

        <p>
            These are Pokémon’s, who can be easily catch in the wildness. Depends on the region, some Pokémon’s are
            commoner
            than others and there are many from the same kind.
        </p>


    </div>

    <div class="starter">

        <h2>Starter Pokémons</h2>

        <p>
            Very seldom in the wildness. When you start your journey, you can pick up from three Pokémons only ones. You
            can decide between a fire, water or grass type Pokémon. In the main games, you won’t get the other starter
            through the main story. In the series, there were some moments where starter Pokémons where in the wildness,
            but these are only exceptions. Starters have always a 3-state evolution line.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="legendary">

        <h2>Legendary Pokémons</h2>

        <p>
            There are many legendary Pokémon’s in every region, but there is only one of his kind. These are powerful
            Pokémon’s and in every main game and always the cover Pokémon for the game. You can always catch this
            Pokémon
            through the story and have it in your team.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="mythical">

        <h2>Mythical Pokémons</h2>

        <p>
            They like legendary Pokémon’s. There is only one of his kind and have a high base stat total. The only
            difference is, they’re much harder to get. You can have a legendary throw the story, while mythical are only
            to
            get on special events, where you can have them only once.
        </p>

    </div>

    <div class="pseudo">

        <h2>Pseudo Legendary Pokémons</h2>

        <p>
            These are Pokémon’s, who are basically general Pokémon’s, but way stronger than an average or good Pokémon.
            Every one of them has a 3-state evolution line and always a base stat total of 600. To compare it, a high
            base
            stat total for general Pokémon are 500 and legendary have over 700, so they are in the perfect middle.
