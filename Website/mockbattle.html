    <h1>Mock battle</h1>
  </div>

  <h2>Battle beginns</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
      At the beginning of a Battle the first Pokemon of each Trainer gets sent out.
      The players can chosse between four actions that they want to do.
      They can either attack, change Pokemon, use items or run.
      The run option can only be used while battleing a wild Pokemon.
      The order of operations goes like this: runnin away goes first, changeing Pokemon goes before using items, using Items goes before attacks and the Pokemon with the higher speed stat attacks first.  
  </p>

  <h2>Running away</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
      While battleing a wild Pokemon, you can chose to run away.
      This can be really usefull when your Pokemon are already damaged from another battle or you simply don't want to battle against a wild Pokemon.
    </p>

  <h2>Changing Pokemons</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
      A trainer can have up to 6 Pokemons.
      If a Pokemon faints then the trainer whose Pokemon fainted has to chose a Pokemon to change to and if the trainer runs out of Pokemons then he loses.
      The other trainer can decide if he also wants to change his current Pokemon.
      Pokemons can also be changed before it faints but the Pokemon that gets changed to loses a turn.
    </p>

  <h2>Items</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
      A Trainer can choose to use Items instead of attacking.
      Items can be used on every Pokemon on the team, not just the one that is currently fighting.
      Pokeballs can be only used on wild Pokemon.
      Potions can be only used on Pokemon that haven't fainted yet and revivers can only be used against Pokemon that have fainted.
      Stat-boosts are one time use Items that only raises the specific stat for one round.
  </p>

  
  <h2>Attacks</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
    There are two kinds of attacks: physical and special.
    A Pokemon can have up to 4 different attacks.
    An attack does not have to neccesarly do damage, but can also be a status buff for itself or a debuf for the enemy.
    The Pokemon with the higher speed stat attacks first.
