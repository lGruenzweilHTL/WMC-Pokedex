## What is Pokemon?
A small website about "Pokemons" from the videogame frenchise "Pokemon".
Contents

In the Pokemon games, the core gameplay is to catch wild creatures called "Pokemon" and make them battle.
This battle goes down in the style of a turn based battle, where a team of up to six Pokemon battle another team.
In the battle, there are a lot of faktors that defines which team shall win.
These Faktors are the moves that the Pokemons have, the types the Pokemon are, and the items the player uses.
The battle goes on until all the Pokemons of one team "faint".

A Pokemon has the following data:
    -Level              The higher the Level, the better the Pokemon. After a Pokemon levels up, it's stats get better. Some Pokemon may even evolve into another Pokemon at a certain level.  
    -Type               Every Pokemon and Move has a Type. Some Move Types are stronger against some Pokemon with a specific type and some are weak against them.

    Stats:
    -Health:            The amount of health points a Pokemon has. If it becomes 0, the Pokemon "faints" and becomes unable to battle.
    -Attack:            This is the amount of Power a Pokemon has in Physical Moves. The higher the Attack is, the stronger the move.
    -Defense:           This is the amount of Defense a Pokemon has against Physical Moves. The higher the Defense is, the lower the damage from the incomming moves are.
    -Special Attack     This is the amount of Power a Pokemon has in Special Moves. The higher the Special Attack is, the stronger is the move.
    -Special Defense    This is the amount of Defense a Pokemon has against Special Moves. The higher the Special Defense is, the lower the damage from the incomming moves are.
    -Speed              The Speed defies which Pokemon attacks first. There are a few moves that ignore this stat and go first anyways unless the enemy also uses a move that goes first.

A move has following data

A move can be either Physical, Special or Status.
Physical and Special moves usually do damage and Status moves usually put a status on either the enemy or itself.

The typing of the Pokemons is like a game of Rock, Paper, Scisors.
Some types are strong against others, some are neutral, some are weak and some are imune.
    -If the type of a move is strong against the type of a Pokemon, then it does double the damage it would normally do.
    -If the type of a move is neutral against the type of a Pokemon, then nothing happens.
    -If the type of a move is weak against the type of a Pokemon, then the Pokemon only recives half the damage.
    -If the type of a Pokemon is imune against the type of a move, then the Pokemon recives no damage at all.

Items are be obtained outside of battle or as a reward after a battle.
    -Pokeballs:     Pokeballs are used to catch wild Pokemon.
    -Potions:       Potions can be used to clear a status efects of a Pokemon or heal them. Potions can't heal fainted Pokemon.
    -Stones:        Stones can be used to make Pokemon evolve. Specific Stones can only be used on a few Pokemon.
    -Vitamins:      Vitamins can be used to strengthen a specific stat of a Pokemon.
    -Revivers:      Can be used to revive Pokemon after they fainted.
    -X-Boosts:      X-Boosts can boost a stat for one turn in a battle.
    -Fishingrods:   Can be used to trigger a battle against Pokemon of the type water.
    -Repels:        Repels are used to repel Pokemon. The player won't get random encounters while a repel is active.
